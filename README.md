# A Review on Routing Protocol of Wireless Sensor Networking
DISSERTATION SUBMITED AS “MINOR PROJECT” IN PARTIAL FULFILMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE AWARD OF THE DEGREE MASTER OF COMPUTER APPLICATIONS (MCA) IN COMPUTER APPLICATION OF WEST BENGAL UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY

# Abstract of the Project
A Review on Routing Protocol in Wireless Sensor Networking defines a brief idea of different types of routing protocols used to make the network through a wireless media. The routers are used to sense the signal from its previous node and sends an information on the basis of the signal to the next neighbor nodes through that wireless network. In this review, we give a brief idea on different types of routing protocol and how they works with sample demonstrations.
